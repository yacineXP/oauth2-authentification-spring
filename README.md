## üöÄ Project Description
The "o2auth-authentification-spring" project is a demonstration of how to secure a RESTful API with OAuth 2 using Spring Security. It is based on the "Securing REST" chapter of the "Spring in Action" book. The project includes the creation of an authorization server, adding a resource server to an API, and consuming OAuth 2‚Äìsecured APIs.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it Works

The project demonstrates how to secure a RESTful API with OAuth 2 using Spring Security. An authorization server is created to authenticate and authorize clients, and a resource server is added to the API to secure the endpoints. The project also shows how to consume OAuth 2‚Äìsecured APIs.

## üíª Code Examples
Here's an example of how to configure an authorization server in Spring Security:
```java
@Configuration
@EnableAuthorizationServer
public class AuthorizationServerConfig extends AuthorizationServerConfigurerAdapter {

    @Autowired
    private AuthenticationManager authenticationManager;

    @Autowired
    private DataSource dataSource;

    @Override
    public void configure(ClientDetailsServiceConfigurer clients) throws Exception {
        clients.jdbc(dataSource);
    }

    @Override
    public void configure(AuthorizationServerEndpointsConfigurer endpoints) throws Exception {
        endpoints.authenticationManager(authenticationManager);
    }

}
```
This code snippet shows how to configure an **authorization server** using Spring Security and the ```@EnableAuthorizationServer``` annotation. The ```@Autowired``` annotation is used to inject dependencies, such as the AuthenticationManager and DataSource.
